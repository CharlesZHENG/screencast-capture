            Simple interface
        </h3>

        <p>
            This is the main application window. The application displays a live preview of what is being
            recorded on video so you don't have any surprises during and after the recording. Screencast Capture also never overwrites a previous recording so you can't accidentally lose your work.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Capture models
        </h3>

        <p>
            The application supports three distinct modes for screen capture: the entire desktop, a fixed region
            of the screen or the contents of a single window. The images below show the capture of a fixed region of
            the screen and a specific window, respectively.
        </p>

        <h3> Capture mouse and keyboard activity </h3>

        <p>The application can register keystrokes and mouse clicks in the recorded video.</p>

        <h3>Choose the best settings for you</h3>

        <p>
            This is the default settings dialog for the application. Here you can configure a few options
            on how to capture audio, video and what to show on screen. The on-screen keyboard state display
            can be customized to better suit your needs.
